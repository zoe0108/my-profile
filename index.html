   Welcome to my profile! I am Zoe, I live in Marseille in the South of France and I am 20 years old. I'm very dynamic, I like sport and I love travelling and discover new places around the world. I did 11 years of tennis! Now I hope to play again this sport. Otherwise, I did some piano and guitar.

    I tell you that I like to play tennis but also I like painting, especially abstract art and modern art. I started to paint at the age of 8 in a paint workshop. I can add that I love eating üòã and to cook desserts!!

    I did an ES baccalaureate in my high school then I went to an economy preparatory class to prepare business school competitions. At the end of the two years, I integrated Kedge Business School. I'm from Bordeaux and I chose to go to Marseille.

  <h2>My experiences</h2>
   <p>
    At Kedge, I joined the Citadingue association. It is a guide of good adresses for the inhabitants and the tourists of Marseille. The Citadingue is also present on social medias. Let's me show you the website :

   <p>
    I have the BAFA : it is a formation to become a children's leader in a children's holiday centre and a activity organizer. I worked 3 weeks in a leisure centre one summer. I learned how to organise days, to work with a team, to be responsible with the children and to create and animate activities.
